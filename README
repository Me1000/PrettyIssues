This is a Safari plugin that converts Github issue URLs to use the Cappuccino github issues app. 

By default you're required to click the button in the toolbar to convert redirect you, but you can
also have the plugin prompt you as you enter an issues page, or redirect you automatically.

- When you click the button while viewing an issue you're automatically redirected to that issues.

- If you're viewing a repo and click the button you will be redirected to that repo's issues.

- If you're not viewing a repo and you click the button you will be redirected to the issues app without the application automatically selecting a repo or issue.
